Orphaned Well Program
September 1, 2020
Purpose
The Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC), a division within the
Department of Natural Resources, prepared this report to document work performed by the
COGCC’s Orphaned Well Program during the State’s Fiscal Year 2020 (or “FY20”), covering the
period from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020. Executive Order D 2018-12 was signed on
July 18, 2018 to improve the environment, public health, and safety of Coloradans by
directing the COGCC to plug, remediate, and reclaim orphaned wells and sites and prevent
future orphaned wells and sites.
